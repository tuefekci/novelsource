# novelsource
A collection of webnovel/novel sources offering varying amounts of scraping capability.

This is mainly build for meta data  and less for content scraping so feel free to push upgrades to the content scraping section because 
thats not my focus, because my main use is to aggregate tags and genres for recommendation if you want to scrape 
the chapter content there are better alternatives listed under alternatives.

### Meta

## Thanks to 
https://github.com/mensch272/novelsave_sources which i used at first and works great but was not a perfect fit for my use case so i build my own it is still the basic inspiration for this lib and a great alternative if you use python.
